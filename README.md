This repository showcases a subtle issue related to Ruby's `method_missing` method.  The example demonstrates how, even after an undefined method is called using `method_missing`, the instance variables remain accessible without issue. This might lead to unexpected behavior in certain scenarios where you'd expect a call to an undefined method to also alter the object's state. The solution offers an approach to modify the behavior if needed.
